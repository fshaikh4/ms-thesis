# Data Sources

We are using [VDH county opioid overdose emergency department (ED) visits](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-surveillance/) data sources as our outcomes data.

To further contextualize county opioid overdose ED visits, we also examine annual population estimates for Virginia counties as produced by the [UVA Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service ](https://www.coopercenter.org/virginia-population-estimates).

We also include geographic data in a shapefile of 2023 Virginia Administrative Boundaries [obtained from the Virginia Geographic Information Network](https://vgin.vdem.virginia.gov/datasets/777890ecdb634d18a02eec604db522c6/about) for later use in exploratory chloropleth mapping.  This shapefile visually represents adjacent counties, but is not by itself in a form accessible to code and implement spatial autocorrelation in our modeling.  Thus, we utilize the [2023 Census Bureau County Adjacency File](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/county-adjacency.html) for this purpose (though we are only interested in Virginia counties).

For relevant additional covariates and predictor measures of interest, we utilize the [County Health Rankings & Roadmaps dataset](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/methodology-and-sources/data-documentation/national-data-documentation-2010-2022).

We handle project directory and data source filepath specification immediately below, before performing data exploration on our 2 major data sources separately in the proceeding sections.  Notably, we also handle data source filepath specification for the aforementioned geographic data.

```{r specify_data_paths}

## Geography of Virginia Counties

This project examines data on Virginia counties as the primary units of analysis.  As a geographic reference, we include below a labeled map of Virginia counties obtained from [the Virginia Association of Counties (VACO) website](https://www.vaco.org/about/regions/):

![](https://www.vaco.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VACoRegionMap23TransparentReduced.png)

### Virginia counties shapefile

Similarly, we generate our own map of Virginia counties and county-equivalents via the previously mentioned 2023 Virginia Administrative Boundaries shapefile, visualized without additional data below:

```{r read_shapefile}
va_counties <- # read shapefile
    st_read(paste0(data_dir_path, va_admin_bound_fname)) %>%
    mutate(NAMELSAD = str_to_upper(NAMELSAD)) # uppercase names to avoid
                                              # capitalization merge conflicts

# plot geographic data
va_counties %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf() +
    theme_void()
```

We will use this template as the basis for chloropleth exploratory data visualizations throughout this process.

### Virginia county adjacencies

We additionaly read-in the US Census Bureau's County Adjacency File and subset to only include Virginia counties.

```{r read_county_adjacency_file}
```

We use this spatial information to later specify spatial autocorrelation in our model.

## Opioid Overdose ED Visits in Virginia Counties

We utilize the Virginia Department of Health website to download data on unintentional drug overdose.  Data are in the form of a Microsoft Excel workbook and are loaded-in via the below chunk:

```{r read_vdh_ed_visits_data, message=F, warning=F}

    excel_sheets(vdh_ed_visits_fullpath) # get list of worksheet "tabs" for MS
                                         # Excel workbook file to mask for
                                         # specific sheet(s)

# reading-in data: VDH opioid overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_nonheroin_opioid <- read_excel(
    path = vdh_ed_visits_fullpath,
    sheet = vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist[5] # locality opioid

vdh_ed_visits_heroin <- read_excel(

    )

    )

## output data: combined ED visits [heroin (opioid) + nonheroin opioid]
combined_edvisits_df <-
    inner_join(heroin_edvisits_df, nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df) %>%
    group_by(Locality, Year) %>%
    rename(
        heroin = `Count: Heroin ED Visits`,
        nonheroin_opioid = `Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits`
    ) %>%
    mutate(
        Year = as.numeric(str_sub(Year, end = -6)), # ensure this is updated to
                                                    # match the data timeframe

    ) %>%

According to VDH criteria, [opioid data seems to exclude "heroin"](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-case-definition/#:~:text=medication%20or%20drug%2C-,heroin,-%2C%20dope%2C%20speed%20ball) ICD codes.  Experts believe heroin opioid overdose deaths have plateaued in the wake of the latest wave(s) of the opioid epidemic, driven now heavily by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.

However, our preliminary exploratory data analysis shows that heroin overdose ED visits in fact continue to contribute to the overall trends in opioid overdose ED visits, so we explore opioid overdose ED visits for all opioids including heroin.

## Population Estimates for Virginia Counties

We contextualize the county opioid overdose ED visits number with the county's population by incorporating annual county population estimates from UVA's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service from 2015 to 2023.  We first read-in the data below, before merging it with the ED visits data above (`combined_edvisits_df`).

```{r read_merge_popest_data}
# preparation for reading-in data: VA county population estimates
va_popest_2010_2020_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, va_popest_2010_2020_fname) # precombine fname parts
va_popest_2020_2023_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, va_popest_2020_2023_fname) # precombine fname parts

# reading-in data: VA county population estimates
va_popest_2010_2020 <- read_excel(
    path = va_popest_2010_2020_fullpath,
    skip = 4 # start at county estimates
) %>%
    rename(
        idx = 1,
        Locality = 2,
        `2010_census` = 3
    ) %>%
    select(Locality, as.character(2010:2019)) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    pivot_longer( # change from wide to long format
        cols = as.character(2010:2019),
        names_to = "Year",
        values_to = "annual_popest",
    ) %>%
    mutate(
        Locality = str_to_upper(Locality),
        Year = as.numeric(Year)
    )

va_popest_2020_2023 <- read_excel(
    path = va_popest_2020_2023_fullpath,
    skip = 4 # start at county estimates
) %>%
    rename(
        idx = 1,
        Locality = 2,
        `2020_census` = 3
    ) %>%
    select(Locality, as.character(2020:2023)) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    pivot_longer( # change from wide to long format
        cols = as.character(2020:2023),
        names_to = "Year",
        values_to = "annual_popest",
    ) %>%
    mutate(
        Locality = str_to_upper(Locality),
        Year = as.numeric(Year)
    )

# merge 2010_2020 and 2020_2023 together (2010_2023)
va_popest_2010_2023 <- bind_rows(
    va_popest_2010_2020,
    va_popest_2020_2023
) %>%
    group_by(Locality)

# merge into combined_edvisits_df
combined_edvisits_df <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    left_join(va_popest_2010_2023)

# visualize popest values
combined_edvisits_df %>% # just exclude VA state this time
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = annual_popest, color = Locality)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ggtitle("Population estimates over time by county") +
    ylab("Annual population estimate") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))

combined_edvisits_df %>% # now exclude Fairfax County as well
    filter(! Locality %in%  c("VIRGINIA", "FAIRFAX COUNTY")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = annual_popest, color = Locality)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ggtitle("Population estimates over time by county\n(excluding Fairfax County)") +
    ylab("Annual population estimate") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))
```

### Calculate opioid overdose ED visit rates per 100K

We use data from VDH for opioid overdose ED visits in conjunction with data from UVA population estimates to transform opioid overdose ED visit counts into rates per 100K population.

```{r calc_ed_visit_rates_per_capita}
combined_edvisits_df <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    mutate(
        combined_rate_per_100k = (combined / annual_popest) * (10**5),
        heroin_rate_per_100k = (heroin / annual_popest) * (10**5),
        nonheroin_opioid_rate_per_100k = (nonheroin_opioid / annual_popest) * (10**5)
    )

# print in wide format to HTML table
combined_edvisits_df %>%
    select(Locality, Year, combined_rate_per_100k) %>%
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = Year,
        values_from = combined_rate_per_100k
    ) %>%
    group_by(Locality) %>%
    summarize_all(sum) %>%
    knitr::kable(style = "html")

# visualize ED visit rate per 100k values
combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = combined_rate_per_100k, color = Locality)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ggtitle("ED visit rates over time by county") +
    ylab("ED visit rates per 100K population") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))
```

These opioid overdose ED visit rates per 100,000 population will serve as our primary outcome measure for our analyses.

## National County Health Rankings & Roadmaps Data

To-be-completed.

```{r read_process_chr_data}
```

Since there is so much data, we will merge in a separate chunk.

```{r merge_chr_data}
```

At this point, we have all relevant data collected into a single data frame, and we can proceed with our analyses.

# Multilevel Modeling

We utilize the following equation for our fully-specified model:

$$y_{i,t} = (\beta_0 + \gamma_{0,i}) + (\beta_{Yr} + \gamma_{Yr,i}) \cdot Year + \beta_{HB} \cdot HealthBehaviors + \beta_{SEF} \cdot SocialEconomicFactors + \beta_{PE} \cdot PhysicalEnvironment$$

Some of our lesser-specified models will omit main/random effects of time (slopes) and also main effects of time-varying covariates.

## "Unconditional Growth" Model

Our first model, referred to as an "Unconditional Growth" model, consists of main and random effects for intercept, but nothing else.

```{r unconditional_growth_model}
# model 1 with counts
model_1_counts <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    filter(Year %in% 2016:2021) %>% # match w/ publication
    lme( # nlme implementation
        fixed = combined ~ 1,
        random = ~ 1 | Locality
    )
    # lmer( # lme4 implementation
    #     formula = combined ~ (1 | Locality)
    # )

summary(model_1_counts)

# model 1 with rates
model_1_rates <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    filter(Year %in% 2016:2021) %>% # match w/ publication
    lme( # nlme implementation
        fixed = combined_rate_per_100k ~ 1,
        random = ~ 1 | Locality
    )
    # lmer( # lme4 implementation
    #     formula = combined_rate_per_100k ~ (1 | Locality),
    # )

summary(model_1_rates)
```

```{r plot_model_1_random_effects}
ranef(model_1_counts) %>%
    rownames_to_column(var = "Locality") %>%
    left_join( # combine above with geography
        va_counties,
        by = c("Locality" = "NAMELSAD") # dplyr 1.0.8 syntax
    ) %>%
    ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(aes(fill = `(Intercept)`, geometry = geometry)) +
    scale_fill_gradient2( # ggplot2 3.3.5 syntax
        midpoint = 0,
        high = "blue",
        mid = "white",
        low = "red",
        na.value = "black",
        guide = "colorbar"
    ) +
    theme_void() +
    ggtitle("Random intercepts for opioid overdose ED visit counts") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))


ranef(model_1_rates) %>%
    rownames_to_column(var = "Locality") %>%
    left_join( # combine above with geography
        va_counties,
        by = c("Locality" = "NAMELSAD") # dplyr 1.0.8 syntax
    ) %>%
    ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(aes(fill = `(Intercept)`, geometry = geometry)) +
    scale_fill_gradient2( # ggplot2 3.3.5 syntax
        midpoint = 0,
        high = "blue",
        mid = "white",
        low = "red",
        na.value = "black",
        guide = "colorbar"
    ) +
    theme_void() +
    ggtitle("Random intercepts for opioid overdose ED visit rates") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))
```

## "Fixed Growth" Model

Our second model, referred to as a "Fixed Growth" model, consists of main and random effects for intercept but only a main effect of time.

```{r fixed_growth_model}
# model 2 with counts
model_2_counts <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    filter(Year %in% 2016:2021) %>% # match w/ publication
    mutate(Year.adj = Year - 2016) %>% # for interpretation
    lme(
        fixed = combined ~ Year.adj,
        random = ~ 1 | Locality
    )

summary(model_2_counts)

# model 2 with rates
model_2_rates <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    filter(Year %in% 2016:2021) %>% # match w/ publication
    mutate(Year.adj = Year - 2016) %>% # for interpretation
    lme(
        fixed = combined_rate_per_100k ~ Year.adj,
        random = ~ 1 | Locality
    )

summary(model_2_rates)
```

```{r plot_model_2_random_effects}
ranef(model_2_counts) %>%
    rownames_to_column(var = "Locality") %>%
    left_join( # combine above with geography
        va_counties,
        by = c("Locality" = "NAMELSAD") # dplyr 1.0.8 syntax
    ) %>%
    ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(aes(fill = `(Intercept)`, geometry = geometry)) +
    scale_fill_gradient2( # ggplot2 3.3.5 syntax
        midpoint = 0,
        high = "blue",
        mid = "white",
        low = "red",
        na.value = "black",
        guide = "colorbar"
    ) +
    theme_void() +
    ggtitle("Random intercepts for opioid overdose ED visit counts") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))

ranef(model_2_rates) %>%
    rownames_to_column(var = "Locality") %>%

## "Random Growth" Model

Our third model, referred to as a "Random Growth" model, consists of main and random effects for both intercept and time.

```{r random_growth_model}
# model 3 with counts
model_3_counts <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    filter(Year %in% 2016:2021) %>% # match w/ publication
    mutate(Year.adj = Year - 2016) %>% # for interpretation
    lme(
        fixed = combined ~ Year.adj,
        random = ~ Year.adj | Locality
    )

summary(model_3_counts)

# model 3 with rates
model_3_rates <- combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>%
    filter(Year %in% 2016:2021) %>% # match w/ publication
    mutate(Year.adj = Year - 2016) %>% # for interpretation
    lme(
        fixed = combined_rate_per_100k ~ Year.adj,
        random = ~ Year.adj | Locality
    )

summary(model_3_rates)
```

## "Random Growth with Time-Varying Covariates" Model

Our final model, referred to as a "Random Growth" model with time-varying covariates (TVCs), consists of main and random effects for both intercept and time as well as main effects for each of our 4 TVCs, taken from CHR data: Health Behaviors, Clinical Care, Social & Economic Factors, and Physical Environment.

```{r random_growth_with_TVCs_model}
```

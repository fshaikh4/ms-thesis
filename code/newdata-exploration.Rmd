# Data Sources

Opioid overdose ED visit rates per 10k ED visit rates for Virginia city/county localities from 2015 to 2023 were obtained via data request to the VDH Division of Surveillance and Investigation, Office of Epidemiology.

We also include geographic data in a shapefile of 2023 Virginia Administrative Boundaries [obtained from the Virginia Geographic Information Network site](https://vgin.vdem.virginia.gov/datasets/777890ecdb634d18a02eec604db522c6/about) for later use in exploratory chloropleth mapping.

We handle project directory and data source filepath specification immediately below, before performing data exploration on our 2 major data sources separately in the proceeding sections.  Notably, we also handle data source filepath specification for the aforementioned geographic data.

```{r specify_data_paths}

## Geography: Virginia Counties

This project examines data on Virginia counties as the primary units of analysis.  As a geographic reference, we include below a labeled map of Virginia counties obtained from [the Virginia Association of Counties (VACO) website](https://www.vaco.org/about/regions/):

![](https://www.vaco.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VACoRegionMap23TransparentReduced.png)

Similarly, we generate our own map of Virginia counties and county-equivalents via the previously mentioned 2023 Virginia Administrative Boundaries shapefile, visualized without additional data below:

```{r read_shapefile}
va_counties <- # read shapefile
    st_read(paste0(data_dir_path, va_admin_bound_fname)) %>%
    mutate(NAMELSAD = str_to_upper(NAMELSAD)) # uppercase names to avoid
                                              # capitalization merge conflicts

# plot geographic data
va_counties %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf() +
    theme_void()
```

We will use this template as the basis for chloropleth exploratory data visualizations throughout this process.

    ) %>%

            `Health Behaviors` = as.numeric(`Health Behaviors`),
            `Clinical Care` = as.numeric(`Clinical Care`),

        )

    chr_data_collector <- chr_data_collector %>%
        rbind(chosen_chr_raw_data)
}
```

## Merge VDH and CHR Data (Using `va_counties` Defined Above)

```{r merge_chr_data}
merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df <- va_counties %>%
    left_join(nonheroin_opioid_long, by = join_by(NAMELSAD == Locality)) %>%
    mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) %>% # for some reason, originally character
    left_join(chr_data_collector, by = join_by(STCOFIPS == FIPS, Year)) %>%
    rename(
        "Locality" = "NAMELSAD",
        "zHB" = "Health Behaviors",
        "zCC" = "Clinical Care",
        "zSEF" = "Social & Economic Factors",
        "zPE" = "Physical Environment",
        "outcome_rate" = `Nonheroin-Opioid ED Visit Rates per 10k ED Visits`
    )

# merged_heroin_edvisits_df <- va_counties %>%
#     left_join(heroin_long, by = join_by(NAMELSAD == Locality)) %>%
#     mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) %>% # for some reason, originally character
#     left_join(chr_data_collector, by = join_by(STCOFIPS == FIPS, Year)) %>%
#     rename(
#         "Locality" = "NAMELSAD",
#         "zHB" = "Health Behaviors",
#         "zCC" = "Clinical Care",
#         "zSEF" = "Social & Economic Factors",
#         "zPE" = "Physical Environment"
#     )
```

At this point, we have all relevant data collected into a single data frame, and we can proceed with further preprocessing steps.

## Filtering based on inclusion/exclusion criteria

Our dataset involve certain localities which are combined and replicated. This seems to be in scenarios where a zip code may be considered to belong to any of multiple localities, so the data deal with this by simply assigning it to the largest locality in the merge (and replicating those combined numbers for the constituent localities). Without removing these replicates, we are potentially oversampling those data points in our model. 

The list of replicated localities is below:

 - Alleghany County and Covington City
 - Albemarle County and Charlottesville City
 - Augusta County, Staunton City, and Waynesboro City
 - Chesterfield County and Colonial Heights City
 - Frederick County and Winchester City
 - Fairfax County, Fairfax City, and Falls Church City
 - Grayson County and Galax City
 - Greensville County and Emporia City
 - Henry County and Martinsville City
 - Montgomery County and Radford City
 - Pittsylvania County and Danville City
 - Prince George County, Hopewell City, and Petersburg City
 - Prince William County, Manassas City, and Manassas Park City
 - Roanoke County, Roanoke City, and Salem City
 - Rockingham County, Buena Vista City, and Lexington City
 - Southampton County and Franklin City
 - Washington County and Bristol City
 - Wise County and Norton City

This leaves us with a final list of the following `r merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df[["Locality"]] |> unique() |> length()` city/county localities:

## Combine Numerical with Geographic Data

**TODO: Create pipeline for visualizing data with combined city/county localities.**

Here they are, mapped: (BROKEN; NEED TO FIX)

```{r map_localities_included}
```

# Exploratory Data Visualization

We begin by creating 2 facet plots, one with a fixed y-axis for all county/city localities (to show trends across county/city localities on the same scale) and one with a "free" y-axis for all county/city localities (the axis "zooms-in" to the scale of a given county/city locality's data, to see more representatively any ups and downs).

```{r plot_facets_localities_rate-per-10k-ED-visits, eval = F}
# run this by hand to generate plots as images (more readable)
merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>% # free_y version
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year.adj, y = outcome_rate)) + 
    geom_line() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +
    facet_wrap(~ Locality, scales = 'free_y') + # free_y allows different y-axes
    theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
    

merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>% # regular, static y-axis version
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year.adj, y = outcome_rate)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +
    facet_wrap(~ Locality) +
    theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 6))

# TODO:
# - save files to output folder
# - implement higher-resolution (potentially SVG?) images
# - add images to document via markdown or HTML commands
```

```{r plot_all_localities_overdose-ED-visit-rate-per-10k-ED-visits}
merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>%
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year.adj, y = outcome_rate, group = Locality)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.1) +
    theme_classic()
```

# Multilevel Modeling

We utilize the following equation for our fully-specified model:

$$y_{i,t} = (\beta_0 + \gamma_{0,i}) + (\beta_{Yr} + \gamma_{Yr,i}) \cdot Year + \beta_{HB} \cdot HealthBehaviors + \beta_{SEF} \cdot SocialEconomicFactors + \beta_{PE} \cdot PhysicalEnvironment$$

Some of our lesser-specified models will omit main/random effects of time (slopes) and also main effects of time-varying covariates.

## "Unconditional Growth" Model

Our first model, referred to as an "Unconditional Growth" model, consists of main and random effects for intercept, but nothing else.

```{r unconditional_growth_model}
# model 1 with rates
model_1_rates <- merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>%
    lme( # nlme implementation
        fixed = outcome_rate ~
            1,
        random = ~ 1 | Locality
    )

summary(model_1_rates)
```

## "Fixed Growth" Model

Our second model, referred to as a "Fixed Growth" model, consists of main and random effects for intercept but only a main effect of time.

```{r fixed_growth_model}
# model 2 with rates
model_2_rates <- merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>%
    lme(
        fixed = outcome_rate ~
            Year.adj,
        random = ~ 1 | Locality
    )

summary(model_2_rates)
```

## "Random Growth" Model

Our third model, referred to as a "Random Growth" model, consists of main and random effects for both intercept and time.

```{r random_growth_model}
# model 3 with rates
model_3_rates <- merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>%
    lme(
        fixed = outcome_rate ~
            Year.adj,
        random = ~ Year.adj | Locality
    )

summary(model_3_rates)
```

## "Random Growth with Time-Varying Covariates" Model

Our final model, referred to as a "Random Growth" model with time-varying covariates (TVCs), consists of main and random effects for both intercept and time as well as main effects for each of our 4 TVCs, taken from CHR data: Health Behaviors, Clinical Care, Social & Economic Factors, and Physical Environment.

```{r random_growth_with_TVCs_model}
# model 4 with rates
model_4_rates <- merged_nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df %>%
    na.omit() %>% # 1 set of z-scores is NA
    lme(
        fixed = outcome_rate ~
            Year.adj +
            zHB + zCC + zSEF + zPE,
        random = ~ Year.adj | Locality
    )

summary(model_4_rates)
```

This document contains exploratory data analysis on opioid overdose data sources (emergency department visits and overdose deaths) to-be used in my thesis project.  I have included relevant package imports in the chunk below:

```{r load_relevant_packages, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(sf)
# library(stringr)
# library(forecast)
# library(broom)
```

# Data Sources

As of now, we are using 2 types of data sources for outcomes data: 

 - Opioid overdose emergency department (ED) visits

 - Opioid overdose deaths

We also include geographic data in a shapefile of 2023 Virginia Administrative Boundaries [obtained from the Virginia Geographic Information Network site](https://vgin.vdem.virginia.gov/datasets/777890ecdb634d18a02eec604db522c6/about) for later use in exploratory chloropleth mapping.

We handle project directory and data source filepath specification immediately below, before performing data exploration on our 2 major data sources separately in the proceeding sections.  Notably, we also handle data source filepath specification for the aforementioned geographic data.

```{r specify_data_paths}
# path specification: data directory
data_dir_path <- # uncomment appropriate option below
    # "d:/Codebase/ms-thesis/data/" # laptop
    "f:/Codebase/ms-thesis/data/" # desktop

# filename specification: overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_fname <-
    "Drug-Overdose-ED-Visits_Virginia-January-2024.xlsx"

# filename specification: overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fname <-
    "cdc-wonder_final-mcd_1999-2020.tsv" # 1999-2020 final
cdc_overdose_deaths_18_21_fname <-
    "cdc-wonder_final-mcd_2018-2021.tsv" # 2018-2021 final

# filename specification: Virginia administrative boundaries shapefiles
va_admin_bound <-
    "VirginiaAdministrativeBoundary.shp/VirginiaCounty.shp"
```

## Geography: Virginia Counties

This project examines data on Virginia counties as the primary units of analysis.  As a geographic reference, we include below a labeled map of Virginia counties obtained from [the Virginia Association of Counties (VACO) website](https://www.vaco.org/about/regions/):

![](https://www.vaco.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VACoRegionMap23TransparentReduced.png)

Similarly, we generate our own map of Virginia counties and county-equivalents via the previously mentioned 2023 Virginia Administrative Boundaries shapefile, visualized without additional data below:

```{r read_shapefile}
va_counties <- # read shapefile
    st_read(paste0(data_dir_path, va_admin_bound)) %>%
    mutate(NAMELSAD = str_to_upper(NAMELSAD)) # uppercase names to avoid
                                              # capitalization merge conflicts

# plot geographic data
va_counties %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf() +
    theme_void()
```

We will use this template as the basis for chloropleth exploratory data visualizations throughout this process.

## ED Visits

We utilize the Virginia Department of Health website to download data on unintentional drug overdose from the [syndromic surveillance webpage](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-surveillance/).  Data are in the form of a Microsoft Excel workbook and are loaded-in via the below chunk:

```{r read_vdh_ed_visits_data, message=F, warning=F}
# preparation for reading-in data: VDH opioid overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, vdh_ed_visits_fname) # precombine fname parts
vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist <-
    excel_sheets(vdh_ed_visits_fullpath) # get list of worksheet "tabs" for MS
                                         # Excel workbook file to mask for
                                         # specific sheet(s)

# reading-in data: VDH opioid overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_nonheroin_opioid <- read_excel(
    path = vdh_ed_visits_fullpath,
    sheet = vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist[5] # locality opioid
)
vdh_ed_visits_heroin <- read_excel(
    path = vdh_ed_visits_fullpath,
    sheet = vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist[6] # locality heroin
)

## output data: nonheroin opioid ED visits

    vdh_ed_visits_nonheroin_opioid["OPIOID"][-1, ] %>%
    rename("Locality" = "OPIOID") %>%
    lapply(
        function(x) str_replace_all(x, "[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", "") # remove special
                                                            # characters (i.e.,
                                                            # double-dagger)
    ) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    mutate(Locality = str_to_upper(Locality)) # avoid name case issues for merge

nonheroin_wide <- # nonheroin opioid ED visits (wide format)

                ts(start = 2015, end = 2023, frequency = 1) # ensure this is
                                                            # updated to match
                                                            # the data timeframe
        },
        simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = TRUE
    )

nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df <-

        values_to = "Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits"
    ) %>%
    mutate(`Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits` =
        as.numeric(`Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits`)
    )

## output data: heroin (opioid) ED visits
heroin_wide <- # heroin ED visits (wide format)
    vdh_localities_df %>%
    cbind(vdh_ed_visits_heroin[dates_vec][-1, ])

    sapply(
        vdh_localities_df[, ],
        function(x) {
            heroin_wide[heroin_wide["Locality"] == x][2:110] %>%
            as.numeric() %>%

        values_to = "Count: Heroin ED Visits"
    ) %>%
    mutate(`Count: Heroin ED Visits` =
        as.numeric(`Count: Heroin ED Visits`)
    )

## output data: combined ED visits [heroin (opioid) + nonheroin opioid]
combined_edvisits_df <-
    inner_join(heroin_edvisits_df, nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df) %>%
    group_by(Locality, Year) %>%
    rename(
        heroin = `Count: Heroin ED Visits`,
        nonheroin_opioid = `Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits`
    ) %>%
    mutate(
        Year = as.numeric(str_sub(Year, end = -6)), # ensure this is updated to
                                                    # match the data timeframe
        combined = sum(c(heroin, nonheroin_opioid)),
    )
```

According to VDH criteria, [opioid data seems to exclude "heroin"](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-case-definition/#:~:text=medication%20or%20drug%2C-,heroin,-%2C%20dope%2C%20speed%20ball) ICD codes.  Experts believe heroin opioid overdose deaths have plateaued in the wake of the latest wave(s) of the opioid epidemic, driven now heavily by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  We therefore visualize heroin ED visits [in a dedicated section](#heroin-visualized) to verify this.

## Overdose Deaths

```{r read_cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_data, warning=F}
# preparation for reading-in data: CDC WONDER opioid overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fname)

    read_tsv(
        cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fullpath, # already in long format
        col_select = c("County", "Year", "Deaths", "Population")) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    mutate(Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)) %>%
    mutate(County = str_sub(str_to_upper(County), end = -5)) # avoid name case
                                                             # issues for merge

cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_20_21_df <- # 2018-2021 data
    read_tsv(
        cdc_overdose_deaths_18_21_fullpath, # already in long format
        col_select = c("County", "Year", "Deaths", "Population")) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    mutate(Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)) %>%
    mutate(County = str_sub(str_to_upper(County), end = -5)) %>%
    filter(Year > 2020) # remove overlap from 1999-2020 data

# data preprocessing: CDC WONDER opioid overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df <- rbind( # data merge: 1999-2020 + 2018-2021
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_df, # 1999-2020 data
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_20_21_df # 2018-2021 data
)

cdc_localities_df <- # derived data frame for geographic masking (as-needed)
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df[, 1] %>%
    unique() %>%
    as.data.frame()

overdose_deaths_wide <- # opioid overdose deaths (wide format)
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>%
    select(c(County, Year, Deaths)) %>%
    group_by(County) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Deaths)

overdose_deaths_tslist <- # overdose death ts objects stored in named list
    sapply(
    cdc_localities_df[, ],
    function(x) {
        overdose_deaths_wide[overdose_deaths_wide["County"] == x, ] %>%
        as.numeric() %>%
        ts(start = 1999, end = 2020) # ensure this is updated to the data
    },
    simplify = FALSE,
    USE.NAMES = TRUE
    )
```

I have downloaded 3 different versions of CDC WONDER data: 

 - bridged-race final multiple causes of death (1999-2020), 

 - single-race final multiple cause of death (2018-2021), and

 - provisional cause of death (2018-feb2024).

Data utilized apropriate ICD10 codes for underlying cause of death as drug overdose and multiple causes of death codes involving opioid drugs, as specified by the [KFF](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-death-rates/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) and a [SAMHSA resource document](https://mnprc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/using-icd-10-codes-to-assess-opioid-related-overdose-deaths.pdf).

# Data Missingness

Below tibbles show the data "fullness" (non-missingness).  We may choose to select Counties for inclusion based on their data availability.  We choose to look at both non-NA as well as {non-NA AND nonzero} non-missingness, since a County with a low population may alternate between zero and missing values based on data suppression.

## ED Visits

```{r tabulate_data_missingness_edvisits}
combined_edvisits_df %>%
    group_by(Locality) %>%
    summarize(
        nonNA_combined_edvisits =
            sum(!is.na(combined)),
        nonzero_nonNA_combined_edvisits =
            sum(!is.na(combined) & (combined != 0))
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(nonzero_nonNA_combined_edvisits)) %>% # sort descending by
                                                       # nonzero & nonNA values
    print(n = 135) # print all 135 counties
```

## Overdose Deaths
```{r tabulate_data_missingness_deaths}
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>%
    mutate(Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)) %>%
    group_by(County) %>%
    summarize(
        nonNA_deaths =
            sum(!is.na(Deaths)),
        nonzero_nonNA_deaths =
            sum(!is.na(Deaths) & (Deaths != 0))
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(nonzero_nonNA_deaths)) %>% # sort descending by nonzero & nonNA
                                            # values
    print(n = 135) # print all 135 counties
```

# Exploratory Data Visualization

We are interested in exploring a few different types of data visualizations for our trajectories of opioid overdose emergency department visits and deaths.  Namely, we are interested in exploring: 

 1. all counties' data,

 2. virginia state-level-aggregated data, and finally

 3. data from a few prespecified Counties/Cities.
 
 We prespecify our desired Counties/Cities for #3 immediately below:

```{r chosen_area_specification}
chosen_areas <- c("ALEXANDRIA CITY", "FAIRFAX COUNTY", "FAIRFAX CITY")
```

## ED Visits

### Combined opioids (incl. heroin)

```{r plotting_county_opioid_ed_visits, eval=F}
# generic plotting function for combined opioid ED visits
combined_edvisits_plotter <- function(locality) {
    combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality == locality) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = combined, group = Locality)) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_point() +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        ggtitle(paste0(locality, ": OPIOID ED VISITS")) +
        ylab("Count: Combined Opioid (incl. Heroin) ED Visits")
}
# plot Virginia state overall
combined_edvisits_plotter("VIRGINIA")

# plot each county (separately)
lapply(vdh_localities_df[["Locality"]], combined_edvisits_plotter)
```

### Heroin alone {#heroin-visualized}

We are interested in verifying claims that heroin ED visits plateau in recent times.  We recreate many of the above plots generated for all opioids (heroin included) below.

```{r plotting_county_heroin_ed_visits, eval=F}
# generic plotting function for heroin ED visits
heroin_plotter <- function(locality) {
    heroin_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality == locality) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Count: Heroin ED Visits`, group = 1)) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_point() +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        ggtitle(paste0(locality, ": HEROIN ED VISITS"))
}

# plot Virginia state overall
heroin_plotter("VIRGINIA")

# plot each county (separately)
lapply(vdh_localities_df[["Locality"]], heroin_plotter)
```

## Overdose Deaths

```{r plotting_county_opioid_overdose_deaths, eval=F}
# generic plotting function for opioid overdose deaths
overdose_death_plotter <- function(locality) {
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>%
    filter(County == locality) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Deaths, group = County)) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_point() +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        ggtitle(paste0(locality, ": OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS")) +
        ylab("Count: Opioid Overdose Deaths")
}

# plot each county (separately)
lapply(vdh_localities_df[["Locality"]], overdose_death_plotter)
```

## Comparison w/ National data

It may be pertinent to compare plots of opioid overdose deaths (especially the Virginia state-level data) to national trends, such as the graph below from the NIDA site:

![](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/2023-Drug-od-death-rates-3.jpeg)

# Exploratory Modeling

Following the above data exploration, we have determined the following:

 - While VDH ED visits data extend through 2023, we do not have reliable CDC WONDER overdose deaths data up to that point; as such, we will use data from both sources through their shared available (and reliable) ranges: from 2015 through 2021.

 - Additionally, we likely want to only include counties with appropriate data availability within our desired ranges.  <mark>As of now, our inclusion/exclusion criteria are TBD.</mark>

Below, we take steps needed to combine our data sources for opioid overdose ED visits and opioid overdose deaths, restricting to our aforementioned shared available (and reliable) ranges.  We additionally combine these data with our Virginia county geography to yield our final data frame for analysis: `alldata_df`.

```{r model_edvisits_and_deaths}
alldata_df <- # merge edvisits and overdose deaths dataframes (and geography)
    combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>% # remove VIRGINIA (state-aggregated) data
                                       # point from edvisits data
    full_join( # combine edvisits and deaths
            cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df,
            by = c("Year" = "Year", "Locality" = "County") # dplyr 1.0.8 syntax

We also print an excerpt of `alldata_summarized` below, to show all coefficients in tabular format and various values:

```{r print_summary_table}
alldata_summarized_df %>%
    select( # select only relevant variables for table display
        Locality,
        edvisits_timecoeff,
        edvisits_pop_coeff,
        edvisits_intercept,
        deaths_timecoeff,
        deaths_pop_coeff,
        deaths_intercept
    ) %>%
    knitr::kable(style = "html")
```

# Remaining Action Items

 - solve `readRDS(pfile): error reading the file` warnings (50+) issue in [first chunk](#load_relevant_packages) (without simply `warning=F` flagging the chunk)

 - properly describe & reference CDC WONDER data selection: underlying causes as overdose and multiple causes to include all classes of opioid drugs

 - determine & document inclusion/exclusion criteria for county-trajectories

 - on a per-county basis, visualize all counties' (meeting inclusion criteria) overdose emergency department visits and overdose deaths on the same plot (vertical axis: "cases" rather than unique individuals, etc.)

 - find & visualize relevant national data on this topic

 - re-download CDC WONDER data to include Virginia state-aggregated data

 - visualize state-aggregated Virginia data in place of old removed CDC WONDER graphic

 - calculate trajectory slopes & intercepts

 - visualize missingness, trajectory slopes, and trajectory intercepts on chloropleth maps

 - visualize missingness, trajectory slopes, and trajectory intercepts on table

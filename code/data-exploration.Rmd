This document contains exploratory data analysis on opioid overdose data sources (emergency department visits and overdose deaths) to-be used in my thesis project.  I have included relevant package imports in the chunk below:

```{r load_relevant_packages, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(forecast)
library(broom)
```

# Opioid Data Sources

As of now, we are using 2 types of data sources: 

 - Opioid overdose emergency department (ED) visits
 - Opioid overdose deaths

We handle project directory and data source filepath specification immediately below, before performing data exploration on our 2 major data sources separately in the proceeding sections.

```{r specify_data_paths}
# path specification: data directory
data_dir_path <- # uncomment appropriate option below
    # "d:/Codebase/ms-thesis/data/" # laptop
    "f:/Codebase/ms-thesis/data/" # desktop

# filename specification: overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_fname <-
    "Drug-Overdose-ED-Visits_Virginia-January-2024.xlsx"

# filename specification: overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fname <-
    "cdc-wonder_final-mcd_1999-2020.tsv" # 1999-2020 final
cdc_overdose_deaths_18_21_fname <-
    "cdc-wonder_final-mcd_2018-2021.tsv" # 2018-2021 final
```

## ED Visits

We utilize the Virginia Department of Health website to download data on unintentional drug overdose from the [syndromic surveillance webpage](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-surveillance/).  Data are in the form of a Microsoft Excel workbook and are loaded-in via the below chunk:

```{r read_vdh_ed_visits_data, message=F, warning=F}
# preparation for reading-in data: VDH opioid overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, vdh_ed_visits_fname) # precombine fname parts
vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist <-
    excel_sheets(vdh_ed_visits_fullpath) # get list of worksheet "tabs" for MS
                                         # Excel workbook file to mask for
                                         # specific sheet(s)

# reading-in data: VDH opioid overdose ED visits
vdh_ed_visits_nonheroin_opioid <- read_excel(
    path = vdh_ed_visits_fullpath,
    sheet = vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist[5] # locality opioid
)
vdh_ed_visits_heroin <- read_excel(
    path = vdh_ed_visits_fullpath,
    sheet = vdh_ed_visits_sheetslist[6] # locality heroin
)

## output data: nonheroin opioid ED visits
dates_vec <- # derived years date-vector for time masking (as-needed)
    2015:2023 %>%
    paste("Total") # Year "Total"

vdh_localities_df <- # derived data frame for geographic masking (as-needed)
    vdh_ed_visits_nonheroin_opioid["OPIOID"][-1, ] %>%
    rename("Locality" = "OPIOID") %>%
    lapply(
        function(x) str_replace_all(x, "[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", "") # remove special
                                                            # characters (i.e.,
                                                            # double-dagger)
    ) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    mutate(Locality = str_to_upper(Locality))

nonheroin_wide <- # nonheroin opioid ED visits (wide format)
    vdh_localities_df %>%

        function(x) {
            nonheroin_wide[nonheroin_wide["Locality"] == x][2:110] %>%
                as.numeric() %>%
                ts(start = 2015, end = 2023, frequency = 1) # ensure this is
                                                            # updated to match
                                                            # the data timeframe
        },
        simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = TRUE
    )

nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df <-
    nonheroin_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(
        cols = dates_vec,
        names_to = "Year", # ensure this is updated to match the data timeframe
        values_to = "Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits"
    )

## output data: heroin (opioid) ED visits
heroin_wide <- # heroin ED visits (wide format)
    vdh_localities_df %>%
    cbind(vdh_ed_visits_heroin[dates_vec][-1, ])

heroin_edvisits_ts_list <- # heroin ED visit ts objects stored in named list
    sapply(
        vdh_localities_df[, ],
        function(x) {
            heroin_wide[heroin_wide["Locality"] == x][2:110] %>%
            as.numeric() %>%
            ts(start = 2015, end = 2023, frequency = 1)
        }, # ensure this is updated to the data
    simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = TRUE
)

heroin_edvisits_df <-
    heroin_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(
        cols = dates_vec,
        names_to = "Year", # ensure this is updated to match the data timeframe
        values_to = "Count: Heroin ED Visits"
    )

## output data: combined ED visits [heroin (opioid) + nonheroin opioid]
combined_edvisits_df <-
    inner_join(heroin_edvisits_df, nonheroin_opioid_edvisits_df) %>%
    group_by(Locality, Year) %>%
    rename(
        heroin = `Count: Heroin ED Visits`,
        nonheroin_opioid = `Count: Nonheroin Opioid ED Visits`
    ) %>%
    mutate(
        Year = as.numeric(str_sub(Year, end = -6)), # ensure this is updated to
                                                    # match the data timeframe
        heroin = as.numeric(heroin),
        nonheroin_opioid = as.numeric(nonheroin_opioid),
        combined = sum(c(heroin, nonheroin_opioid)),
    )
```

According to VDH criteria, [opioid data seems to exclude "heroin"](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-case-definition/#:~:text=medication%20or%20drug%2C-,heroin,-%2C%20dope%2C%20speed%20ball) ICD codes; may be relevant to combine opioid and heroin data from VDH sources.

## Overdose Deaths

```{r read_cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_data, warning=F}
# preparation for reading-in data: CDC WONDER opioid overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fname)
cdc_overdose_deaths_18_21_fullpath <-
    paste0(data_dir_path, cdc_overdose_deaths_18_21_fname)

# reading-in data: CDC WONDER opioid overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_df <- # 1999-2020 data
    read_tsv(
        cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_fullpath, # already in long format
        col_select = c("County", "Year", "Deaths", "Population")) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    mutate(Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)) %>%
    mutate(County = str_sub(str_to_upper(County), end = -5))

cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_20_21_df <- # 2018-2021 data
    read_tsv(
        cdc_overdose_deaths_18_21_fullpath, # already in long format
        col_select = c("County", "Year", "Deaths", "Population")) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    mutate(Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)) %>%
    mutate(County = str_sub(str_to_upper(County), end = -5)) %>%
    filter(Year > 2020) # remove overlap from 1999-2020 data

# data preprocessing: CDC WONDER opioid overdose deaths
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df <- rbind( # data merge: 1999-2020 + 2018-2021
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_99_20_df, # 1999-2020 data
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_20_21_df # 2018-2021 data
)

cdc_localities_df <- # derived data frame for geographic masking (as-needed)
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df[, 1] %>%
    unique() %>%
    as.data.frame()

overdose_deaths_wide <- # opioid overdose deaths (wide format)
    cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>%
    select(c(County, Year, Deaths)) %>%
    group_by(County) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Deaths)

overdose_deaths_tslist <- # overdose death ts objects stored in named list
    sapply(
    cdc_localities_df[, ],
    function(x) {
        overdose_deaths_wide[overdose_deaths_wide["County"] == x, ] %>%
        as.numeric() %>%
        ts(start = 1999, end = 2020) # ensure this is updated to the data
    },
    simplify = FALSE,
    USE.NAMES = TRUE
)
```

I have downloaded 3 different versions of CDC WONDER data: 
 - bridged-race final multiple causes of death (1999-2020), 
 - single-race final multiple cause of death (2018-2021), and
 - provisional cause of death (2018-feb2024).

Data utilized apropriate ICD10 codes for underlying cause of death as drug overdose and multiple causes of death codes involving opioid drugs, as specified by the [KFF](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-death-rates/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) and a [SAMHSA resource document](https://mnprc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/using-icd-10-codes-to-assess-opioid-related-overdose-deaths.pdf).

# Data Missingness

Below tibbles show the data "fullness" (non-missingness).  We may choose to select Counties for inclusion based on their data availability.  We choose to look at both non-NA as well as {non-NA AND nonzero} non-missingness, since a County with a low population may alternate between zero and missing values based on data suppression.

## ED Visits
```{r tabulate_data_missingness_edvisits}
combined_edvisits_df %>%
    group_by(Locality) %>%
    summarize(
        nonNA_combined_edvisits =
            sum(!is.na(combined)),
        nonzero_nonNA_combined_edvisits =
            sum(!is.na(combined) & (combined != 0))
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(nonzero_nonNA_combined_edvisits)) %>% # sort descending by
                                                       # nonzero & nonNA values
    print(n = 135) # print all 135 counties
```

## Overdose Deaths
```{r tabulate_data_missingness_deaths}
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>%
    mutate(Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)) %>%
    group_by(County) %>%
    summarize(
        nonNA_deaths =
            sum(!is.na(Deaths)),
        nonzero_nonNA_deaths =
            sum(!is.na(Deaths) & (Deaths != 0))
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(nonzero_nonNA_deaths)) %>% # sort descending by nonzero & nonNA
                                            # values
    print(n = 135) # print all 135 counties
```

# Exploratory Data Visualization

We are interested in exploring a few different types of data visualizations for our trajectories of opioid overdose emergency department visits and deaths.  Namely, we are interested in exploring: 

 1. all counties' data,
 2. virginia state-level-aggregated data, and finally
 3. data from a few prespecified Counties/Cities.
 
 We prespecify our desired Counties/Cities for #3 immediately below:

```{r chosen_area_specification}
chosen_areas <- c("ALEXANDRIA CITY", "FAIRFAX COUNTY", "FAIRFAX CITY")
```

## ED Visits

```{r plotting_county_opioid_ed_visits}
combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>% # all county data (messy)
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = combined, group = Locality)) +
        geom_line(aes(color = Locality)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = Locality)) +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none")

combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality == "VIRGINIA") %>% # Virginia state overall
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = combined, group = Locality)) +
        geom_line(aes(color = Locality)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = Locality)) +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none")

combined_edvisits_df %>%
    filter(Locality %in% chosen_areas) %>% # chosen areas
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = combined, group = Locality)) +
        geom_line(aes(color = Locality)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = Locality)) +
        theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Overdose Deaths

```{r plotting_county_opioid_overdose_deaths}
cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>% # all county data (messy)
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Deaths, group = County)) +
        geom_line(aes(color = County)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = County)) +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "none")

cdc_wonder_overdose_deaths_df %>%
    filter(County %in% chosen_areas) %>% # chosen areas
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Deaths, group = County)) +
        geom_line(aes(color = County)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = County)) +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(legend.position = "top")
```

It may be pertinent to compare plots of opioid overdose deaths (especially the Virginia state-level data) to national trends, such as the graph below from the NIDA site:

![](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/2023-Drug-od-death-rates-3.jpeg)

Below, I have generated a plot via CDC wonder of Virginia state-level opioid overdose data over time:

# Exploratory Modeling

Following the above data exploration, we have determined the following:

 - While VDH ED visits data extend through 2023, we do not have reliable CDC WONDER overdose deaths data up to that point; as such, we will use data from both sources through their shared available (and reliable) ranges: from 2015 through 2021.
 - Additionally, 



# Remaining Action Items
 - solve `readRDS(pfile): error reading the file` warnings (50+) issue in [first chunk](#load_relevant_packages) (without simply `warning=F` flagging the chunk)
 - properly describe & reference CDC WONDER data selection: underlying causes as overdose and multiple causes to include all classes of opioid drugs
 - describe missingness/suppression/etc of VA counties for each data source
 - merge CDC WONDER data files: evaluate merge based on # of mismatches b/w overlapping years (2018-2020)
    - merge 1: 1999-2020 final (bridged-race) + 2018-2021 final (single-race)
    - merge 2: merge 1 + 2018-feb2024 provisional
    - keep merge 1 and merge 2 separate, for final versus provisional analyses
 - determine & document inclusion/exclusion criteria for county-trajectories
 - visualize all-county (meeting inclusion criteria) overdose emergency department visits
 - visualize all-county (meeting inclusion criteria) overdose deaths
 - on a per-county basis, visualize all counties' (meeting inclusion criteria) overdose emergency department visits and overdose deaths on the same plot (vertical axis: "cases" rather than unique individuals, etc.)
 - find & visualize relevant national data on this topic

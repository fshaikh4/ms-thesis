# Data and Preprocessing

## Data source

Opioid overdose ED visit rates per 10k ED visit rates for Virginia city/county localities from 2018 to 2025 were obtained from the public-facing VDH Syndromic Surveillance webpage for [Drug Overdose ED visits](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/syndromic-surveillance/drug-overdose-surveillance/). Previously, data were obtained via either the same public-facing webpage or data request from VDH Division of Surveillance and Investigation, Office of Epidemiology, from 2015 to 2023. These data have been combined in visualization at the moment, with future plans to submit another formal data request for all available data (2015 through 2024), after proof-of-concept for this project has been established.

    # loop through both heroin & nonheroin-opioid sheets
    
    # pull sheet data: monthly overdose ED visit rates per 10K ED visits
    heroin_dataframe <- #
    
    # pull nonheroin-opioids data

## Data inclusion/exclusion criteria

### Unit of analysis: Virginia city/county locality

This project examines data on Virginia cities and counties (more generally, "localities") as the primary units of analysis. As a geographic reference, below is a labeled map of Virginia counties obtained from [the Virginia Association of Counties (VACO) website](https://www.vaco.org/about/regions/):

![](https://www.vaco.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VACoRegionMap23TransparentReduced.png)


### Data exclusion/aggregation: (Replicates of) combined localities

Our dataset involve certain localities which are combined and replicated. This seems to be in scenarios where a zip code may be considered to belong to any of multiple localities, so the data deal with this by simply assigning it to the largest locality in the merge (and replicating those combined numbers for the constituent localities). Without removing these replicates, we are potentially oversampling those data points in our model. 

The list of replicated localities is below:

 - Alleghany County and Covington City
 - Albemarle County and Charlottesville City
 - Augusta County, Staunton City, and Waynesboro City
 - Chesterfield County and Colonial Heights City
 - Frederick County and Winchester City
 - Fairfax County, Fairfax City, and Falls Church City
 - Grayson County and Galax City
 - Greensville County and Emporia City
 - Henry County and Martinsville City
 - Montgomery County and Radford City
 - Pittsylvania County and Danville City
 - Prince George County, Hopewell City, and Petersburg City
 - Prince William County, Manassas City, and Manassas Park City
 - Roanoke County, Roanoke City, and Salem City
 - Rockingham County and Harrisonburg City
 - Rockbridge County, Buena Vista City, and Lexington City
 - Southampton County and Franklin City
 - Washington County and Bristol City
 - Wise County and Norton City

### Data exclusion: Localities w/ data quality issues prior to 2021

 In addition, “VDH updated the method used to assign Virginia localities based on zip code in July 2021. As a result, the Rates per 10,000 ED Visits for 2021 may have changed compared to previously published data for the following localities: Appomattox, Buchanan, Dickenson, Dinwiddie, Frederick, Gloucester, Greensville, Hampton, Harrisonburg, Henrico, James City, Lancaster, Lexington, Manassas Park, Mathews, Nelson, Northumberland, Orange, Prince Edward, Prince George, Prince William, Richmond City, Rockbridge, Rockingham, Spotsylvania, Sussex, Winchester, York.” **As such, those city/county localities were also excluded from our analyses for data quality concerns.**

```{r recode-remove-quality-issues-localities}
# recode localities with data quality issues for removal
monthly_rates_combined_long <- monthly_rates_combined_long %>%
    mutate(Locality = case_match(
        Locality,
        "APPOMATTOX COUNTY" ~ "(QUALITY) APPOMATTOX COUNTY",

    filter(!grepl("\\(QUALITY\\)", Locality))

## Final dataset

After removing city/county localities which were replicates in [Data exclusion/aggregation: (Replicates of) combined localities] and removing those with data quality/continuity issues prior to 2021 in [Data exclusion: Localities w/ data quality issues prior to 2021], we are now left with the following list of localities:

```{r final-locality-list}
monthly_rates_combined_long %>%
    select(Locality) %>%
    filter(Locality != "VIRGINIA") %>% # remove state-level data from list
    unique() %>%
    as.vector()
```

# Exploratory data analysis

## Data Missingness (and Zero Values)

```{r summarize-missingness, results = "asis", eval=F}
monthly_rates_combined_long %>%
    group_by(`Locality`, `FIPS`, `measure_name`) %>%
    summarize(
        nonNA_value_count = sum(! is.na(measure_value)),
        nonzero_nonNA_value_count = sum(! is.na(measure_value) & (measure_value != 0))
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(nonzero_nonNA_value_count)) %>%
    kbl("html") %>%
    kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

### Monthly rate subseries plots

# Project To-Do List
 - read-in annual data as well
 - properly "functionize" data reading-in code
 - generate polar seasonal plots (for monthly rates)
 - pull-in prior data file from 2015 as well, and compare overlapping data
 - send in a request to VDH for the data from 2015 onwards, and ask if they can simply format the data as requested as well
 - explore MS Word report generation 
 - ~~render kables properly for HTML~~
 - ~~filter properly to unique geographies (remove replicates)~~
 - ~~implement custom addition rules for NAs for combined opioid data (currently any constituent NA means combined is NA)~~
  - ~~SOLUTION: treat NA as 0 for the sum (since NA is due to low-number supression)~~
 - ~~change trajectory plots' x-axes to include quarters and minor gridlines for each quarter/month? (and/or add points?)~~
  - ~~SOLUTION: instead made major gridlines for years, and formatted x-axis in Q format (still only showing years, so Q1)) ~~

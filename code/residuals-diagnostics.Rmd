The goal of this document is to perform residual diagnostics on our various mixed-effects models to ensure we are not violating any assumptions of this technique.

# Data loading and preprocessing (based on inclusion/exclusion criteria)

We begin by loading-in our data from our previous multi-level modeling notebook (after it had been preprocessed):
```{r load_data}
setwd('D:/Codebase/ms-thesis') # hardcoded for now, for laptop
combined_edvisits_df <- readRDS('./data/VA-county-opioid-ED-visits-2015-to-2023.RDS') %>%
    mutate(Year.adj = Year - 2015) %>% # implement global year-adjustment here
    filter(Locality != 'VIRGINIA') # to make things easier, county-only
```

Our dataset involve certain localities which are combined and replicated. This seems to be in scenarios where a zip code may be considered to belong to any of multiple localities, so the data deal with this by simply assigning it to the largest locality in the merge (and replicating those combined numbers for the constituent localities). Without removing these replicates, we are potentially oversampling those data points in our model. 

The list of replicated localities is below:

 - Alleghany County and Covington City
 - Albemarle County and Charlottesville City
 - Augusta County, Staunton City, and Waynesboro City
 - Chesterfield County and Colonial Heights City
 - Frederick County and Winchester City
 - Fairfax County, Fairfax City, and Falls Church City
 - Grayson County and Galax City
 - Greensville County and Emporia City
 - Henry County and Martinsville City
 - Montgomery County and Radford City
 - Pittsylvania County and Danville City
 - Prince George County, Hopewell City, and Petersburg City
 - Prince William County, Manassas City, and Manassas Park City
 - Roanoke County, Roanoke City, and Salem City
 - Rockingham County, Buena Vista City, and Lexington City
 - Southampton County and Franklin City
 - Washington County and Bristol City
 - Wise County and Norton City

This leaves us with a final list of the following `r combined_edvisits_df[['Locality']] |> unique() |> length()` city/county localities:

# Full-dataset data exploration and model specification

To begin, we will make our work as close to prior published work as possible. Though our outcome variable is slightly different (published: average monthly opioid overdose ED visit rates per 100k population; our: average monthly opioid overdose ED visit rates per 10k ED visits, soon-to-be-replaced by an annual-aggregated opioid overdose ED visit rates per 10k ED visits), we can mimick the model specification for each of our mixed model types (in increasing sophistication/terms: unconditional growth, fixed growth, random growth, and random growth with time-varying covariates). Before this, however, we should explore our outcome variable.

### Data exploration

We begin by creating 2 facet plots, one with a fixed y-axis for all county/city localities (to show trends across county/city localities on the same scale) and one with a "free" y-axis for all county/city localities (the axis "zooms-in" to the scale of a given county/city locality's data, to see more representatively any ups and downs).

```{r plot_localities_rate-per-10k-ED-visits, eval = F}
# run this by hand to generate plots as images (more readable)
combined_edvisits_df %>% # free_y version
    ggplot() + 
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Year.adj, y = ed_visit_rate_per_100K.nonheroin_opioid)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Locality, scales = 'free_y') + # free_y allows different y-axes
    theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 6))

combined_edvisits_df %>% # regular, static y-axis version
    ggplot() + 
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Year.adj, y = ed_visit_rate_per_100K.nonheroin_opioid)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Locality) +
    theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 6))

# TODO:
# - save files to output folder
# - implement higher-resolution (potentially SVG?) images
# - add images to document via markdown or HTML commands
```

Now that we have explored our data a little, let's get into specifying our mixed models and looking at their residuals.

### Model specification

We provide the same types of models as before, called as such:

 - Unconditional growth: intecept-only model with random intercept
 
 - Fixed growth: intercept and time-slope model with random intercept
 
 - Random growth: intercept and time-slope model with random intercept and slope

 - Random growth with time-varying covariates: self-explanatory, though we may need to look into the validity of using time-varying covariates in a model like this (potentially looking at additional residual diagnostics).

Now that we have specified our models, let's engage in examining residuals and performing diagnostics.

### Residual diagnostics

For each type of model, we are interested in diagnosing residuals in accordance with the guidance found in the [Introduction to Multilevel Modeling online text](https://www.learn-mlms.com/12-module-12.html#an-aside-extracting-residuals):

 - level-1 residuals (at individual data-point level) are independent of level-1 predictors, based on visual inspection of scatterplots and/or correlation coefficients
 - level-1 residuals are normally distributed, based on visual inspection of quantile-quantile (qq) plots and/or Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
 - level-2 residuals (at the group level, in our case, for each county/city locality) are independent of one another and of level-2 predictors, based on visual inspection of scatterplots and/or correlation coefficients
   - what are level-2 predictors? (time-varying covariates? random effects?)
 - THIS LIST IS UNFINISHED; GO THROUGH WORD DOCUMENT AND ADD MISSING BULLETS

# List of things that need to get done before thesis meeting
 - remove replicated localities from data
 - perform residual diagnostics for each of the published models, using all data
 - perform residual diagnostics for the main model, using all data
 - perform residual diagnostics for 1 model type, using data from 2015 to 2021 to predict 2022
  - perform residual diagnostic for same model as above, using data from 2015 to 2022 to predict 2023, and show forecast performance
  - perform residual diagnostic for the same model as above, using data from 2015 to 2021 to predict both 2022 and 2023, and show forecast performance
